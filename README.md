# cljc-minimals

This repository is meant to bridge the gap between
tutorials or documentation, which come in the form
of code snippets, on the one hand, and more complex
example projects. The latter in and of themselves can be great
because such selected stacks of technologies are
carefully selected by the authors and embody knowledge
of how things fit together nicely.

Here the focus is more on how to use certain libraries
***within*** a project ***context***, but a very ***minimal*** one, such
that one is able to see the moving parts at a glance. 
It is meant to provide starting points which are known to work, 
from which one then can diverge and explore further functionalities
of the respective libraries.

If time permits and I'm not running out of ideas, expect
new examples to pop up here in the future. Or maybe you have
one you are willing to share?
